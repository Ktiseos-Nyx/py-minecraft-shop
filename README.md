# Simple Chest Shop - Py-Spigot Edition

## Overview

Simple Chest Shop is a user-friendly and efficient chest shop plugin for Py-Spigot servers.  Designed to be straightforward and easy to use, it fills the need for a simple yet functional shop system without the complexities often found in other plugins.  It seamlessly integrates with TownyAdvanced, allowing players to create and manage shops within their towns and plots.  With Geyser support, Bedrock Edition players can also fully participate in the chest shop economy alongside Java Edition players.

Inspired by the core functionality of classic chest shop plugins, Simple Chest Shop provides a clean and intuitive experience, prioritizing ease of use and essential features for both players and server administrators.

*   **Simple to Configure:**  Straightforward configuration options for server administrators.
